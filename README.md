Now, if you are thinking something like:
“But, wait… I am new to GitHub and I do not understand very well how all of this works… What are the different tabs? What are the issues? And the wiki?”
Don’t worry, we all felt that same way at some point, and we know it’s hard, so we’ve built a sort of “guide me through it”. Take a look at How to navigate this site wiki page in this same repository.

## Darwin Core Questions & Answers and Darwin Core Hour Series, how do they relate?
It’s simple. 
* [Darwin Core Questions & Answers](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa) site is where you are now. This is the place where all questions get submitted to via the [Darwin Core Hour Input Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekd0QSdgiK5ujh6CLZPx9kKTcS-mJRNK_pGWk3b3fHv4x4gQ/viewform?c=0&w=1), where answers are permanently captured, and where documentation is built and made available for consultation ([Questions & Answers pages](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-qa/wiki) in the wiki for this repository).
* [Darwin Core Hour series](https://www.idigbio.org/content/darwin-core-hour-webinar-series) is a series of periodical talks (that we friendly call “the Webinars”) that address some of the topics laid out as questions in this site, and where there is an instance to discuss directly with the speakers and the rest of the community.

### So… how are they related?
Well, as you can see in the graph below, they feed each other: questions submitted to this site give birth to topics for webinar talks, and more questions from those webinar talks are submitted to this site. And, out of both, answers get to the community and documentation is continuously built.
