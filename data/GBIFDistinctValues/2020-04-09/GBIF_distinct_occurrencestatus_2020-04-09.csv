"Both males and females of this beautiful species are a deep metallic-blue, but females have broad black margins with hite spots. The undersides of both sexes are brown with a row of brown-ringed, orange eyespots outlined with pale, metallic-bronze. Females also have a broken band of mettalc-yellow bronze. Blue morphos fly rapidly through dense forest and feed on the juices of fallen fruit. Males are particullarly active, chasing each other in bright sunlight. They will even chase a blue cloth waved in the air; this device has been used by colectors to lure these fast moving butterflies that are otherwise difficult to catch.",1
"Both sexes of this species are identical except that the females are slightly larger than the males. The upperside of L. a. arthemis is mostly blackish-blue with white postmedian bands across both wings. Some individuals have a row of red submarginal spots, while others have this area being blue. The underside of the wings is a blackish color with a broad white post-median band. The basal area of both wings contains many red spots. The submarginal area may contain a row of red spots and the marginal area having bluish spots. However, sometimes the submarginal and marginal areas are just a reddish-brown color.",2

On the upperside of the hindwings they have a row of black dots. The hindwings have white and orange bands and a series of black dots inside them, also clearly visible on the reverse. Females are usually more dull than males with more developed black dots. Caterpillars are about 25 mm long with a reddish-brown head and a spiny black body with small white dots. Melitaea cinxia is rather similar to the heath fritillary (Melitaea athalia), but the beige and orange bands on the underwings are distinctive. Moreover the latter one has no spots on the upperside of the hindwings.",3

"P. palinurus but very much broader; the discal band of the forewing measured on the dorsum occupies considerably more than one-third of the dorsal length, while the discal band of the hindwing is as broad posteriorly as it is anteriorly (in P. Papilio palinurus has a wingspan reaching about 8?10 centimetres (3.1?3.9 in). The dorsal sides of the wings are covered by a powder of green scales and the background vary from dark greenish to black, with broad bright emerald green metallic bands. The undersides are black with orange, white and blue spots along the edges of hindwings, that show extended tails at the end. The flight of these butterflies is swift and quite fast. Caterpillars feed on plants of genus Euodia belonging to the Rutaceae, commonly known as the rue or citrus family.",2

"The common checkered-skipper has a wingspan of 19 to 32 mm. It gets its name from the checkerboard pattern on its wings; the male tends to have broader bands than the female. The body tends to be blue-gray with the small amount of ""fuzz"" which is seen in all skippers.",4
The common kind at this site.,1
"The distinctive red barred black forewings with white spots make this an easy butterfly to recognize. The underside of the forewing is similar to, though paler than, the upperside, while the hindwing underside is patterned with brown and black. The sexes are similar. Red admirals are strong flying butterflies and often migrate.",3
The high brown fritillary's wingspan is on average around 65 mm. Its upper wings are orange with black markings and the undersides are colored a duller orange with white and brown markings. While flying it is very hard to distinguish from the dark green fritillary which has many of the same markings. The male and female fritillary share many of the same physical features. Larvae are brown with a single longitudinal white stripe down the length of their body. Their bodies are covered in brown spikes which aid in camouflaging them from predators as they move among dead fern fronds.,7
"The hingwing row of small, black spots on this black and orange buttefrfly is very distinictive. The undersides of the forewing are similar to the uppersides, but the hindwing undersides are colored yellowish white with orange and black markings and silvery spots.",2
"The length of the wings is 31?34 mm for males and 28?36 mm for females. Adults are on wing nearly year round.They are notable for the presence of blue pigments in their wings, as opposed to blue created by physical structures.The larvae feed on Alchornea costaricensis and Plukenetia volubilis.",2
The less common kind at this site but still quite frequent.,1
"The male of this beautiful species of butterfly has more blue on the upperside than its female counterpart. The underside of rhe wings have a distinictive, striking pattern of black and yellow ringed eyespots on a brown background. Common morphos are attracted to fermenting fruit.",11
"The patterning on this exquisite butterfly is unique. In conrast to the striking upperside, the underside is dark brown with purplish black lines, providing good camouflage. The females are slightly larger than the males.",9
"The striking eyespots of this butterfly make it easy to recognize, although the markings can be variable. The sexes are similar. Eary stages: the caterpillar is green to blackish grey and marked with orange and yellow. It feeds on plantains.",23
The striking patches of metallic color found on the hindwings of the place this butterfly in a group called the gloss papilios. Female Paris Peacocks are usually yellower than the males.,1
The upperside of this butterfly is a very pale green with distinctive black markings. The underside is also pale with orange-brown lines. Malachites are on the wing all year in the tropics. They feed on fermenting fruit.,1
The upperside of this butterfly is a very pale green with distintive black markings . The underside is also pale with orange-brown lines. Malachites are on the wing all year in the tropics. They feed on fermenting fruit.,2
"The uppersides on the forewings of both sexes of this karge butterfly are shot with iridescent purple, although it is most evident in the darker male. The female has brown hindwings shot with white lines. The undersides are similar, but lack the iridescenes. This speices belongs to a large Indo-Australian genus known as crow butterflies because of their iridescent dark colors. Both catepillars and adults are poisonous.",1
"The wingspan is 30 to 35 millimetres (1.2 to 1.4 in).The uppersides of the forewings are black with a broad red median band and a blue basal area. Also the uppersides of the hindwings are black, while the electric-blue area is larger and extended up to the edges. The undersides of the forewings are similar to uppersides but show also a yellow band. The basic colour of the undersides of the hindwings is black, with four pale blue or yellow spots in the middle of a black oval surrounded by concentric yellow bands.",1
The wingspan is about 11 ? 13 cm. Papilio menestheus is a member of the family PAPILIONIDAE. The basic colour of this butterfly is brown. Yellow spots and bands dominate the wings.,1
"The wingspan is about 85 mm. Adults have an iridescent-blue patch, which is confined to the discal area of the hindwing. There is also a series of submarginal eyespots.",1
"They are purplish-green with two longitudinal, greenish-yellow stripes on each side and the dorsal side. When full-grown, they are approximately one and a quarter inches long.[3] The wingspan in adults is 63?86 mm. Adults are on wing all year round in southern Texas, peninsular Florida and along the Gulf Coast. A.monuste is a migrating species that moves in one direction within its life span and does not return. It breeds in Florida but sometimes migrates along the coast up to 160 km to breed in more suitable areas.",1

"This beautiful butterfly belongs to a group of similar species. The pattern if metallic. greenish blue on black is very striking and quite variable, many forms have been named. The underside by contrast is grayish brown, with a dark central band. The sexes are similar. when in flight these butterflies make a crackling sound.",9
"This beautiful butterfly has three major color forms. In all three the forewings are similar in their patterning of black and pale yellow, but the hindwing markings may be orange, blue or green. The underside of the forewing is similar to the upperside, the hindwing is black with white rays. The sexes are alike.",1

"This butterfly can be distinquished from the small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae) by its larger size, its hairy appearance, and the lack of white markingson the leding edge of its forewings. The underside is patterned with various shades of brown and has a distinctive marginal band of slate-gray.",8
"This butterfly is easily recognized by its translucent forewings and drooping tail. The only other species in this genus (lamproptera curius) can be distinguished by the presence of a transverse white band on the wings. Green dragontails resemble dragonflies in flight and have a rapid wingbeat. Even when resting, they vibrate their wings. Unlike the majority of butterflies, they hover over flowers while feeding.",1
This form common here.,1
This form occasional with no bloom on berries,1
"This from a flourishing colony of C. monogyna of 50+ trees, the only hawthorns seen in the Oakridge area",2
This golden yellow fringed butterfly has no tails. It is dark and the hindwings usually have a green luster. The underside is patterned with  red. These swallowtails are distasteful to birds.,3
"This highly variable butterfly mimics many different species belonging to various groups. It can be distinguished from similar species by its long yellow antennae and its relatively small head. The underside is similar in appearance to the  upperside, but with white spots along the dark brown margins. They are on the wing for most of the year. Both sexes visit flowers.",16
This is an amaziningly variable butterfly. Almost all variations are matched by parallel forms in the postman (H. melpomene) and the two speices occur in the same habitats. Similar forms occur in both sexes. Butterflies fly close to the ground along forest margins and open ground. They roost communally at night.,1
This is an uninspiring but well-known and widely distributed species distinguished by its small size and simple blck wing markings. Females have a yellow hue and two black spots on the forewing. Cabbage butterflies are on the wing from spging to autum. The  caterpillar is yellowish green. It feeds on cultivatedand wild cabbage and other related plants.,5
This is probably the most common deciduous species of the bottom land.,1
"This is the most spectacular speices in this small genus of distinctive yellow butterflies. The deeo orange center on the forewing of the male is characateristic, as are the slight hindwing tails. Females are larger and much paler, with only a trace of color. Cleopatras can be distinquished from other speices by the presence of a faint orange streak on the inderside of the forewing. They are on the wing from late winter to autum, particularly in Medierranean costal areas.",6

"This largely black species can have pink, ruby or purplish patches on the hindwing. The butterflies mimic swallowtails of the genus Parides.",7
This little butterfly is one of the most commonest speices in the northern hemisphere. The forewings are bright orange-red with black spots and and dark grey borders. The hindwings are pgedominately dark grey.,7
This orange coloured fritillary has rows of dark dots or chevrons at the wing edges and black or brown lines more proximally.The ventral sides of the wings are also orange with several rows of white dots. Its wingspan is between 51 and 73 mm.,6

In both sexes, the uppersides of the forewings are dark brown with a bluish suffusion and a white line running through. The hindwings are blck with a dull blue base. The undersides of the wings have an intricate brown and white featherlike pattern. Owl butterflies fly early in the morning and towards dusk.",7
"This strking, blackish brown butterfly, with it's bright orange-brown wingtips and white bands is easily recognizable. Females are similar to males but larger. The underside pattern is paler and duller than the upperside, and the white hindwing bad is margined with orange-brown. Adults tend to fly close to the ground, where they feed from forest flowers.",1
This taxon plentiful here,2
